What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and 
ReverseLines.printReverse? 
To make sure that the methods print out and the test pass.

Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one 
recursive call to the next? 
These methods need arguments to store data, the argument change from one 
recursive call to the next through the node


What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as
ReverseLines.printReverse? 
PopulateList: time O(n) space O(n); populateFifoList: time O(n) space O(n) and printReverse: time O(n) space O(n)

Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops? 
PopulateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.
